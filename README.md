Java-based Graph Drawing Tool
Overview
The Java-based Graph Drawing Tool is an interactive application developed in Java, designed to create, visualize, and analyze both directed and undirected graphs. The tool supports drawing nodes and edges, performing graph algorithms, and saving/loading graph structures. It is a versatile tool for graph enthusiasts and students looking to explore graph theory concepts.

Key Features
Graph Drawing GUI: Use mouse and keyboard to add, remove, and edit nodes and edges on a canvas.
Graph Representation: Graphs are represented using matrix-based and set-based structures for flexibility.
Graph Algorithms:
Check if the graph is Eulerian or semi-Eulerian.
Check if the graph is connected.
Find Eulerian paths and circuits.
Check if the graph is Hamiltonian.
Compute shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Saving and Loading: Graphs can be saved for later use and reloaded for further editing or analysis.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling ensures stability and provides feedback for invalid user actions.
Technologies Used
Language: Java
Framework: Java Swing for GUI
Graph Algorithms: Eulerian path/circuit, Hamiltonian cycle, Dijkstra’s algorithm
